# Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM)

Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM) is a simple but complete implementation of the Java Transaction API (JTA) 1.1. This eXtended Architecture (XA) transaction manager provides all services required by the JTA while keeping the code as simple as possible for easier understanding of XA semantics.

The master version of the current source was built and published on the [Maven Central repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.marcus-nl.btm).

## Credits

BTM was created and maintained by the Bitronix team and its community, especially [@bitronix](https://twitter.com/bitronix) and [@BrettWooldridge](https://twitter.com/BrettWooldridge). 

Scalar, Inc., took over this great project so that we can continue to maintain and build on the project. We would like to thank [@bitronix](https://twitter.com/bitronix) and [@BrettWooldridge](https://twitter.com/BrettWooldridge) for their innovative work on BTM.
